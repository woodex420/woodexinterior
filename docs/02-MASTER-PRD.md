## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Problem

- **Leads are lost.** The current studio site's contact form is a demo that captures nothing.
- **The old admin cannot be trusted.** The v2.1/v2.5 platform keeps money in JSON blobs, has no data
  integrity and leaked credentials.
- **Follow-ups depend on memory.** There is no SLA and no single view of the client across WhatsApp,
  phone, website and social.
- **Website changes need a developer.** This puts the 142-page SEO footprint at risk with every edit.

### 1.2 Vision

> **One system where every enquiry becomes a tracked opportunity, every quotation and invoice is
> professional and traceable, every conversation is in one inbox, the owner runs the business from
> Telegram, and the team can restyle and grow the website without a developer.**

### 1.3 Scope summary

| Release | Phases | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| **R1 Sales OS** | P0–P3 | Foundation, CRM, lead capture, quotations, invoices, payments, v2.1 import, Telegram alerts |
| **R2 Conversations** | P4–P5 | WhatsApp Cloud API, unified inbox, website chat + AI bot, sequences, real-time, Telegram command centre |
| **R3 Website** | P6 | New Preline/Studio website, 142 URLs, theme builder, page builder, SEO, estimator, booking |
| **R4 Social** | P7 | Facebook + Instagram inbox/comments/Lead Ads/scheduler, LinkedIn posting + lead sync |
| **R5 Client experience** | P8–P9 | Projects, client portal, reviews, hardening, training |

### 1.4 Non-goals (v1)

- Full accounting / general ledger and tax returns. Woodex OS exports to the accountant.
- HR/payroll, inventory/warehouse, procurement purchase orders. PO tracking could come later.
- LinkedIn direct messages (no public API).
- A free-form drag-and-drop website canvas (D-03 chose blocks + tokens).
- Native mobile apps. The admin is mobile-responsive, and Telegram covers mobile control.

| GLB-002 | **Global search (Ctrl/⌘ K)** finds contacts, leads, quotes, invoices, projects and conversations by name, company, phone (any format: `0322…`, `+92322…`, `322…`) or document number (`WI-10123`). Results appear in < 500 ms for 50k records. | M | P1 |
| GLB-003 | Every list screen supports: search, filters, sort, pagination (25/50/100), saved views per user, column chooser, CSV export (permission `export`), bulk actions where relevant. | M | P1 |

| GLB-007 | Tags on contacts and leads (colour, filterable). | S | P1 |
| GLB-008 | Notification centre (bell): unread count, mark read, deep links. It updates in real time when broadcasting is configured; otherwise it polls every 30 s while visible. | M | P1 |
| GLB-009 | **Audit log** for create/update/delete/status change of business records (who, when, IP, old→new values), plus logins, 2FA changes, settings and role changes. | M | P0 |

## 5. Module requirements

### 5.1 CAP: Lead capture (all channels → one pipeline)

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Ph |
|---|---|---|---|
| CAP-001 | Public endpoint `POST /api/public/leads` (JSON) accepts name, phone, email, city/area, service, business line, property type, area size, budget band, timeline, message, page URL, referrer, UTM parameters, `gclid`/`fbclid`, consent flag and Turnstile token. | M | P1 |
| CAP-002 | Protection: rate limit (5/min/IP, 20/day/phone), honeypot field, minimum fill time (3 s), Cloudflare Turnstile verification when configured, CORS allow-list (`woodex.com.pk`, `www`, admin domain). | M | P1 |
| CAP-003 | **Lead Capture Service** (one class used by every channel): normalise phone → find or create contact (match phone, then email) → create lead (or attach to an open lead for the same contact + line within 30 days) → store source + attribution → score → assign → start SLA → fire `LeadCaptured` event. | M | P1 |
| CAP-004 | Sources (enum, extensible in Settings): website form, estimator, booking, website chat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram DM, Facebook Lead Ad, Instagram Lead Ad, LinkedIn Lead Gen, LinkedIn comment, phone call, walk-in, referral, returning client, import, manual. | M | P1 |
| CAP-005 | First-touch and last-touch attribution: landing page, referrer, UTM source/medium/campaign/content/term, click IDs, device. They are stored on the lead and shown on the timeline. | M | P1 |
| CAP-006 | Auto-reply to the client: WhatsApp template "enquiry received" (P4; before P4, an email if an email was given) in the client's language, with studio hours and the next step. | M | P4 |
| CAP-007 | **Bridge mode:** the endpoint accepts posts from the current live site (P1–P6) with a per-origin API key, so live-site enquiries reach the new CRM before the website rebuild. | S | P1 |
| CAP-008 | Manual quick-add (+ Lead) with duplicate warning while typing the phone ("Contact exists: Ali Raza, 2 open leads"). | M | P1 |
| CAP-009 | CSV import of leads/contacts with column mapping, preview, dedupe report and rollback of the batch. | S | P1 |
| CAP-010 | Public success response returns a reference (`L-2026-000123`) and the WhatsApp deep link for the visitor to continue on WhatsApp. | S | P1 |

**Acceptance: CAP-003 (critical path)**

- *Given* a visitor submits the website form with phone `0322-4000768`, *when* the request is valid,
  *then* a contact exists with phone `+923224000768`, a lead with stage **New**, source **website form**
  and UTM data is created, the assignee receives a Telegram + in-app alert within **60 s**, and the API
  responds `201` with a reference in **< 800 ms**.
- *Given* the same phone submits again within 30 days for the same line, *then* no new lead is created.
  The enquiry is added to the existing open lead's timeline and the owner is notified as "returning
  enquiry".
- *Given* Turnstile is configured and the token is invalid, *then* the API returns `422` and nothing is
  stored except a rate-limited spam log entry.

### 5.2 CRM: Leads, contacts, pipeline, tasks, visits

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Ph |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRM-001 | **Contacts**: person record (name, phones (multiple, one primary + WhatsApp flag), emails, city, area, address, preferred language, client type: individual/company/developer/architect, tags, consent flags, notes). Optional link to a **company**. | M | P1 |
| CRM-002 | **Companies**: name, type, NTN (optional), phones, emails, address, website, contacts list, all leads/quotes/invoices. | S | P1 |
| CRM-003 | **Leads (opportunities)**: contact, business line (Interior / Furniture / Project), service, property type, location, area (sq ft), budget band, timeline, lead type (new / returning / referral + referrer), priority (low/normal/high), stage, owner, next action + due, expected value, probability, lost reason, source/attribution. | M | P1 |
| CRM-004 | **Pipeline stages** (configurable, ordered, typed open/won/lost, with probability): **New → Contacted → Site Visit → Quotation → Negotiation → On Hold → Won / Lost**. Moving to Lost requires a reason (Settings list). Moving to Won requires an accepted quote or an owner override. | M | P1 |
| CRM-005 | **Pipeline board** (Kanban, drag and drop between stages; columns show count and total expected value; filters by owner, line, source, date). **List view** with the same filters. Switching between them keeps the filters. | M | P1 |
| CRM-006 | **Next action** is mandatory on open leads: call / WhatsApp / site visit / meeting / email + due date-time. Overdue next actions appear in red on My Day and trigger reminders. | M | P1 |
| CRM-007 | **Tasks**: title, type, due, assignee, related record, priority, status; recurring option; reminders (in-app/Telegram). | M | P1 |
| CRM-008 | **Site visits**: date/time slot, address + Google Maps link, assigned staff, client confirmation status, reminders (client WhatsApp D-1 and 2 h before; staff Telegram), outcome form (measurements, photos, notes, next step). Calendar view (day/week/month) and conflict warning. | M | P1 |
| CRM-009 | **Assignment rules**: by line, service, city/area and source; round-robin among active users of a role; working-hours aware; manual reassign with reason; workload cap per user. | M | P1 |
| CRM-010 | **SLA timers**: first response target per source and priority (default 15 min in hours; outside hours, the next business day at 10:30). Breach → escalate to sales manager (Telegram) → owner after a second threshold. | M | P1 |
| CRM-011 | **Lead scoring** (0–100) from rules in Settings: budget, area, service, city, source, engagement (quote viewed, replies). Shown as a badge; used for sorting and alerts ("hot lead"). | S | P1 |
| CRM-012 | **Duplicate detection and merge** for contacts (same normalised phone or email, similar name). The merge moves all related records and keeps an audit entry. | M | P1 |
| CRM-013 | **My Day**: today's visits, overdue and due-today next actions, new leads assigned to me, quotes awaiting follow-up, conversations waiting for me. | M | P1 |
| CRM-014 | **Segments**: saved contact filters (e.g., "Clients in DHA", "Lost due to budget, last 6 months") usable for broadcasts and exports. | S | P4 |
| CRM-015 | Contact 360 page: profile, open/closed leads, quotes, invoices, payments, projects, conversations (all channels), files and the full timeline. | M | P1 |
| CRM-016 | Calls: log call outcome quickly (connected / no answer / busy / wrong number / call back) from list, drawer or Telegram. Three "no answer" outcomes in a row propose a WhatsApp template. | M | P1 |

**Acceptance: CRM-005 / CRM-004**

- Dragging a card from *Contacted* to *Site Visit* without a scheduled visit opens the
  "Schedule visit" modal. Cancelling the modal returns the card to its column.
- Dragging to *Lost* opens a required "Lost reason" select. The stage change, reason and user are
  written to the timeline and audit log.
- The board with 500 open leads renders in < 1.5 s. Drag-drop saves in < 300 ms (optimistic UI, rollback
  on error).

|---|---|---|---|
| QUO-001 | **Rate book**: catalogue items (category, description, unit (sft, sqmt, rft, nos, each, set, point, job, lumpsum, views), rate, finish level essential/standard/premium, line Interior/Furniture, active flag). Seeded from the real Woodex catalogue (22 items + decor library + 6 estimator services). | M | P2 |
| QUO-002 | **Quote templates**: named sets of sections + items + default terms + payment-milestone plan + notes. 16 templates are seeded from real Woodex BOQs (Renovation, Civil Work, Interior Designing, Interior, Fit-out, Architecture, 3D Visualization, Furniture, Design Consultancy, and the 7 "Scope of Work" templates). | M | P2 |
| QUO-003 | **Builder**: create from template, from blank or by duplicating a quote. Sections can be added, renamed and reordered (drag). Items are added from the rate book (search) or as free text. Each line has qty (3 decimals), unit, rate, line discount (%/amount), optional/included flag and internal cost (hidden from the client). Inline editing; keyboard navigation (Enter = new line). | M | P2 |
| QUO-004 | **Totals computed on the server** in paisa: line = round(qty × rate) − line discount; section subtotals; quote discount (%/amount); taxes (configurable rates per line or quote, default none, with an "exclusive of taxes" note); rounding rule; grand total; **margin %** visible to staff only (from internal costs). | M | P2 |
| QUO-005 | **Payment milestones** per quote from a plan: execution **50/40/10** (advance / civil+wood completion / handover), design **75/25** (advance / approval), or custom. Percentages must total 100%. | M | P2 |
| QUO-006 | **Numbering**: Interior/Project **WI-10100+**, Furniture **WF-10050+** (from Settings). The number is assigned when the quote is first saved. Revisions keep the number and add `R1`, `R2`. | M | P2 |
| QUO-007 | **Approval**: if the discount exceeds the user's limit (Settings per role, e.g. sales 5%, manager 10%) or the margin falls below the minimum, sending is blocked until an owner/manager approves (admin or Telegram inline button). | M | P2 |
| QUO-008 | **Send**: generate the PDF; create an immutable **version snapshot**; send via WhatsApp template "quotation" with a signed link button (P4; before P4, a copyable link + email); record `sent` event. | M | P2 |

| QUO-010 | **Tracking**: events for created, sent, delivered (WhatsApp status), viewed (each view with time, device, duration), downloaded, accepted, changes requested, expired, declined. Owner gets Telegram alerts: first view, repeat views (≥ 3 in 24 h = "hot"), acceptance, change request. | M | P2 |
| QUO-011 | **Acceptance automation**: lead → Won, contact → client, project created (from line/template), advance invoice drafted (or issued, per Settings) and sent, thank-you message with payment details for the correct bank (Interior → Bank Alfalah "WOODEX INTERIOR"; Furniture → Meezan "WOODEX FURNITURE"; wallets per Settings). | M | P2/P3 |
| QUO-012 | **Validity and reminders**: validity days (default 15). Follow-up sequence on day 2, 5 and 12 if not accepted (stops on reply/accept/decline). Auto-expire after validity; one-click "re-issue with new validity". | M | P2 |
| QUO-013 | **Revisions**: editing a sent quote creates a new revision. The client link always shows the latest revision; older revisions are viewable by staff with a diff summary (items/totals changed). | M | P2 |
| QUO-014 | **PDF**: A4, Studio letterhead (logo, address, NTN optional), client block, scope summary, sections table, totals, amount in words, milestones, terms, bank details, signatory blocks (**Imtiaz Ahmad, Director** · **Nabeel Afzal, Marketing Manager**, from Settings), page numbers, quote number on each page.

| QUO-017 | Quick estimate → quote: website estimator results (service × area × finish) can be converted into a draft quote. | S | P6 |
| QUO-018 | Urdu PDF variant of terms and headings (body items stay English). | C | P9 |
| QUO-019 | **Quote options**: alternative proposals under the same number (e.g. `WI-10123 · Option A / Option B`, different finishes) shown side by side on the client page; accepting one closes the others. (v2.1 already used options.) | S | P2 |
| QUO-020 | **Other charges** line (rent, transport, scaffolding) added after the subtotal and before tax, as in the v2.1 documents. | M | P2 |

**Acceptance: QUO-004 / QUO-008 / QUO-011**

- A quote with 40 lines (fractional quantities such as `121.125 sft × Rs 1,200`) yields totals equal to
  the reference calculation **to the paisa**. Unit tests cover rounding, discounts, taxes and milestones.
- After sending, editing any line in the builder prompts "Create revision R1?". The original snapshot and
  its PDF stay unchanged and downloadable.
- Accepting on the client page (valid link, not expired) marks the quote *accepted*, moves the lead to
  *Won*, creates a project and a 50% advance invoice for an execution template, and notifies the owner
  on Telegram. **The whole chain is one database transaction plus queued notifications.**

### 5.4 INV: Invoices, payments, receivables

  100,000. The first invoice becomes *paid*, the second *partially paid* (balance Rs 150,000). The aging
  report updates immediately.

## 9. Key end-to-end acceptance scenarios (release gates)

1. **R1 gate: "Enquiry to receipt".** A web enquiry → Telegram alert → assign → call logged → visit
   booked + reminder → visit outcome with measurements → quote from the Renovation template → discount
   approval via Telegram → sent link → viewed alert → accepted → project + 50% invoice → client uploads
   proof → accountant verifies → receipt sent. Every step appears on the contact timeline, and all money
   values reconcile.
2. **R1 gate: "Migration".** Importing v2.1 yields equal counts (± merged duplicates listed) and equal
   totals for quotes, invoices and payments. Staff log in with new passwords.
3. **R2 gate: "WhatsApp day".** Inbound WhatsApp from an unknown number → bot qualifies → lead created →
   hand-off → agent replies in window → outside the window only templates are allowed → quote link
   delivered with read receipt → usage meter counts the messages.
4. **R3 gate: "SEO-safe launch".** 142/142 URLs green in the parity test on staging, CWV targets met, theme
   change published and rolled back without a deploy, 404 log empty after 48 h of production traffic
   (or redirected).
5. **R4 gate: "Social lead".** Facebook Lead Ad test lead appears in the CRM in < 1 min with campaign info
   and an automatic WhatsApp template. A scheduled IG + FB + LinkedIn post publishes on time.
