 * Money follows the job (slice E): every milestone a live project has reached becomes its invoice, once.
 *
 * The advance invoice is still raised the moment the owner accepts the quotation; this command is what
 * bills the milestones that come after it. It is also the catch-up: a project whose advance was never
 * raised (accepted before the invoice automation existed, or the acceptance job failed) is picked up on
 * the next run, because the rule is simply "reached, accepted quotation, no invoice yet".
