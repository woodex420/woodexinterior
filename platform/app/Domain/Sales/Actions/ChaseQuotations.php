/**
 * Quotations do not answer themselves (AUT, quotation step 3).
 *
 * Three quiet jobs, run once a day:
 *  1. **Chase** — a quotation sent days ago with no answer: the owner and the salesperson are told to call.
 *  2. **Warn** — a quotation whose price lapses in a few days: told once, before it is too late to save it.
 *  3. **Lapse** — a quotation whose validity has passed: marked expired, logged, and the team told, so a stale
 *     price is never quoted again by accident.
 *
 * The system never writes to the client by itself. It tells the studio, and the studio calls — a person decides
 * what to say to a client who has gone quiet.
 *
 * Each nudge is remembered on the quotation as an event, so the same quotation is not chased every single day:
 * after a chase the clock restarts, and after three the quotation is left alone — a client who has not answered
 * three times has answered.
