 * These used to be .env-only. They are settings now so the owner can connect WhatsApp from the dashboard on
 * shared hosting, while the .env still works as a fallback — see App\Integrations\WhatsApp\WhatsAppCredentials.
 * The three real secrets are encrypted at rest by EncryptedStringCast and are never shown back to the browser:
 * the form offers an empty box with a masked hint, and leaving it empty keeps the saved value (D-115).
 *
 * Note: never use @var on properties: spatie/laravel-settings parses @var to infer casts and rejects
 * generic types such as array<string, int>. Use @phpstan-var for those (spatie ignores it).
